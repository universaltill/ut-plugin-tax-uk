# Reusable plugin-repo i18n drift guard template (ut-docs#1882).
#
# Any ut-plugin-* repo can copy this file verbatim into its own scripts/
# and wire it into CI (see architecture/plugin-architecture.md §7). It
# checks a plugin's own locales/*.json overlay files — the convention
# ADR-0010 / plugin-architecture.md §7 documents — for the same drift class
# universal-till's own scripts/ci/guard-i18n.sh catches in core:
#
#   1. every non-base locale file has EXACTLY the same key set as
#      locales/en.json — no missing translations, no orphan keys
#      (mirrors guard-i18n.sh check #2).
#   2. every locale value is a flat string — a nested JSON object would
#      silently defeat check 1's key-set comparison (it only ever looks at
#      TOP-level keys, so drift inside a nested object is invisible to it)
#      and can't round-trip through config.I18n.T() anyway, which expects a
#      plain string. plugin-architecture.md §7's own convention is a flat,
#      prefixed key (`tax_de.rate_label`), not a nested object — this
#      check makes that the only shape the guard will accept, rather than
#      silently no-op'ing on anything else (found in review, ut-docs#1882).
#   3. every locale value's printf/template verbs (%d, %s, {{name}}, {0},
#      ...) match en.json's for that key — ported verbatim from
#      guard-i18n.sh check #8 (ut-docs#1865/#1873): checks 1-2 above only
#      compare key SETS, so a translation could drop/invent/change a verb
#      while keeping the same key and ship a live `%!d(MISSING)` (found in
#      review, ut-docs#1882 — the same defect class core already hit once).
#   4. no locale file defines the same top-level key twice — json.load
#      silently keeps only the last one, so this re-scans the raw text
#      instead of trusting the parsed object (mirrors guard-i18n.sh check
#      #9, ut-docs#1872).
#   5. every manifest.json entries[].label that is KEY-SHAPED (a flat,
#      lowercase, dot-namespaced token like `tax_de.rate_label` — never a
#      literal with spaces/punctuation a human would actually read) must
#      resolve in locales/en.json (ut-docs#1883 review, F1/F2). This is
#      the one check that runs even with NO locales/ directory at all: a
#      key-shaped label with nothing backing it is exactly the class of
#      bug that shipped a real German-pilot regression — ut-plugin-tax-de
#      0.5.4 changed two entries[].label values to locale keys, but its
#      OWN scripts/package.sh didn't include locales/ in the release
#      artifact, so `syncLocales()` found nothing to overlay and the raw
#      key (e.g. `tax_de.entry_dsfinvk_export_label`) would have rendered
#      to a merchant instead of "DSFinV-K Export (fiskaly)" — this guard
#      existed at the time and would NOT have caught it, because it only
#      checks locale-file-to-locale-file drift, never manifest-to-locale
#      resolution. This check closes that specific gap; it does not (and
#      cannot) verify the PACKAGED artifact actually contains locales/ —
#      that's `scripts/package.sh`'s own job, verify its `entries=(...)`
#      array separately.
#
# Deliberately narrower than guard-i18n.sh's full check list otherwise: a
# plugin ships a WASM/asset bundle, not a Go html/template app, so no
# plugin repo in this org ships a `{{ T "key" }}` template, a Go-side
# w.Write/RenderError call site, or a ToastMessage field for checks
# 1/3/6/7 of the core guard to scan. As of 2026-09-10 (ut-docs#1883), a
# plugin's `page`-type entries (pre-existing, plugin_page.go) and
# `export`/`report`-type entries (this card, settings.html) resolve their
# manifest label through core's `T` via this locales/*.json overlay
# mechanism; `payment`/`theme`/`button`-type entry labels and every
# plugin's generic settings-field labels do NOT — those still render
# whatever literal string the manifest carries, with no translation path
# at all (a separate, known, cross-cutting core gap, tracked outside this
# card — see architecture/plugin-architecture.md §7's own note on this).
# If a plugin's own UI surface grows a template/render path later, extend
# this template rather than assuming key-set parity alone still covers it.
#
# A plugin with no locales/ directory at all passes cleanly — shipping
# translations is optional (ADR-0010) — so a plugin can wire this guard in
# on day one, before its first locale file ever exists, and get drift
# protection from the very first key it adds rather than only once someone
# remembers to add the guard later.
#
# Usage: scripts/guard-plugin-i18n.sh [ROOT_DIR]
#   ROOT_DIR defaults to the current directory; a plugin repo's own CI step
#   normally calls this with no argument, run from the repo root.
